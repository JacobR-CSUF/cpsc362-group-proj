## Project Description

Our team has been tasked with integrating **AI-based features** into an existing large-scale social media platform.  
The goal is to enhance user engagement and experience through intelligent features such as:
- AI-generated captions for photos/videos  
- Smart content recommendations  
- Automated moderation and safety filters  
- Personalized feed ranking  

This project will:
- Define our **software development philosophy**  
- Establish a **custom software development framework** aligned with the core team's release cycle  
- Prototype, develop, and deploy new **AI-powered features**  
- Maintain long-term compatibility with the existing infrastructure
